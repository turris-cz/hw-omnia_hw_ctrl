* It is possible to set these voltages: 3.3V, 3.6V, 4.5V, 5.1V
* HW modification of the board is needed as well (see electric diagram)
* Default voltage after enabling the regulator is 4.5V
* Write only
* The procedure has two steps
** 1. step - enable the dc/dc regulator 
*** "i2cset 1 0x2A 2 0x2020 w"
**** 1 -> i2cbus number
**** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
**** 2 -> "address of the register" = command
**** 0x2020 - enable the regulator
**** w -> word data type

** 2. step - set desired voltage
*** "i2cset 1 0x2A 6 1 b"
**** 1 -> i2cbus number
**** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
**** 6 -> "address of the register" = command
**** 1 - value for 3.3V
***** values for voltages:
1 -> 3.3V; 
2 -> 3.6V; 
3 -> 4.5V; 
4 -> 5.1V; 
**** b -> word data type


=== CMD_GET_RESET

* It should "solve" a freezing of the router when the DDR training sequence fails

* Example of a writing to the watchdog state
** "i2cset 1 0x2A 0x0B 0 b"
*** 1 -> i2cbus number
*** 0x2A -> I2C address of the slave
*** 0x0B -> "address of the register" = command
